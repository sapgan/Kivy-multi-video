Kivy-multi-video
================

This is an example app for accommodating multiple videos on same screen. Keep all the videos organised in different folders under videos folder in the same folder as the code and the code will take care of the rest
To use a different folder as source for the videos mention the full path of the folder in the "SOURCE" variable in main.py file
Keep videos in the subfolders and then run main.py
